    % NOTE ON OBTAINING THE SOLUTION: Here I use a vectorization approach to easily determine the solution. However, this approach requires inverting a nm times nm matrix, which could be problematic for large problems. To avoid this, a generalized eigenvalue/eigenvector approach should be implemented in the future.
    % To do this, add a check for regularity and disjoint generalized spectra of the matrix penxils (A + x C), (D - x B), then apply generalized eigenvectors to calculate X element by element.

    % Calculate the vectorization of the solution X by using the kronecker product (for any matrices A, B, C, vec(A*B*C) = kron(transpose(C),A)*vec(B))
    kronecker_vectorization_factor = kron(transpose(B),A) + kron(transpose(D),C);
    
    % Before trying to calculate the inverse, check that it is invertible. If it is not invertible, then there does not exist a unique solution to the generalized Sylvester equation (there is either no solution, or there is an infinite set solutions)
